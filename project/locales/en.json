I have experience building web pages from scratch with pure CSS and with preprocessors like SASS and LESS, I use their frameworks like Boostrap and Tailwind. I can create prototypes with design tools like Figma. My basic training started at the Platzi Web Development school and to this day I keep myself updated and learning new technological tools, I apply the motto 'NEVER STOP LEARNING' to have more specific knowledge in a self-taught way. Programming taught me that every day we encounter problems, making a good analysis, creating suitable strategies, generate high-quality results.",
